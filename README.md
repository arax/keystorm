# Keystorm
The federated authentication component for rOCCI-server.

Keystorm allows users to authenticate using several protocols, currently
OIDC(OpenID Connect) and VOMS(Virtual Organization Membership Service). After
successful authentication, the user is given an unscoped token that is generated
from credentials received from a valid authentication protocol. User can use the unscoped
token to generate a scoped token that is used to access a cloud service.

# Requirements
- Ruby 2.2.7+
- OpenNebula 5.2+ (when using OpenNebula cloud provider)
- Memcache

# Installation
In production Keystorm must *NEVER* be accessible remotely. It should run under an
Apache2 server that handles authentication and forwards credentials to Keystorm.

## Apache2
Default Apache2 configuration can be found in `example/apache2`
